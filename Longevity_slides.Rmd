# Background

```{r agingfig}
knitr::include_graphics("images/An_Aging_Nation.png")
```

# Motivation

```{r twomr, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/General_DAG.png")
```

**Longevity is complex**
  
  - Confounding makes finding true associations difficult
  
**Solution** : Two Sample Mendelian Randomization

 - use two datasets from similar populations
 
 - provide strong evidence of the true relationship between longevity and certain exposures

# Methods

```{r twomrfig, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2MR.png")
```


**Two Sample Mendelian Randomization**

- Exposure: SNPs as a proxy for Exposure from one dataset
- Outcome: outcome from another dataset using SNPs from Exposure to assess the causal relationship between Exposure and Outcome, bypassing confounders that influence the E-O relationship.

**Advantages**

  - readily available data
  
  - simple analyses
  
  - cost-efficient


# Assumptions 

```{r assumptions, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2MR.png")
```

**Assumption 1** : The first assumption is that SNPs are truly associated with Exposure

**Assumption 2** : No Horizontal Pleiotropy

**Assumption 3** : SNPs not associated with E-O confounders

# Assumption # 1 

**Assumption 1**

```{r assumption1, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2MR.png")
```

**Assumption 1** : The first assumption is that SNPs are truly associated with Exposure, as seen from independent studies

- limit exposures which are significantly associated with SNPs from other GWAS studies


# Assumption # 2  

**Assumption 2**

```{r assumption2, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2MR.png")
```

**Assumption 2** : No Horizontal Pleiotropy

- SNPs are associated with outcome through Exposure only

# Assumption # 3  

**Assumption 3**

```{r assumption3, out.width= "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/2MR.png")
```

**Assumption 3** : SNPs not associated with E-O confounders


 - the lack of confounders is partly what allows us assume that the randomness of allele inheritance is equivalent to random assignment in an RCT



# Violations of Assumptions

**Weak Instruments** : when the SNP is not strongly associated with the exposure

  - low power
  - bias association towards the null
  
**Horizontal Pleiotropy** : refers to the effects of the SNPs on the outcome not mediated by the exposure

  - when a SNP is related to multiple traits independent of the exposure  
  
    - requires adjusted methods to estimate our association of interest even when present 



# Methods for Determining Estimates Overview

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/LD.png")
```

**LD Clumping**

  - clump SNPs that are close to each other



**Inverse Variance Weighted**

- simplest method to calculate the MR estimate

- requires all assumptions of the model to be med

**Egger**

- estimates are unbiased in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy
   
    - suffers from low power
    
    - weak instruments can influence the regression and therefore the estimate


**Median Weighted**

- estimates are unbiased for up to 50% weak or invalid instruments



# TWoSampleMR Package

**Software- TwoSampleMR Package**

R package developed to utilize 2-sample Mendelian Randomization on GWAS studies with curated databases. 
Allows researchers to more easily perform 2-sample Mendelian Randomization on GWASs to discover and eludicate possible causal relationships between phenotypes and evaluate assumptions of this statistical strategy.

# Detecting Violations

**Heterogeneity** : estimates are not consistent across independent instruments

- suggests that an assumption is being violated

  - difficult to detect
  
  - possible causes : horizontal pleiotopy, non-homogenous underlying populations in the study, weak instruments
  
- TwoSampleMR package: use mr_heterogeneity() function

  - Q statistic :
    - review definition
    - will perform a test of heterogeneity on harmonized data
  
    
Horizontal Pleiotropy

**Horizontal Pleiotropy** : refers to the effects of the SNPs on the outcome not mediated by the exposure

- TwoSampleMR: use mr_pleiotropy_test()
   - if significant,  there is the presence of horizontal pleiotropy 

      

**SNPs associated with E-O confounders**  

- difficult to prove positively to due complex biological pathways and unknown confounded

- can be tested with known confounded of the Exposure-Outcome relationship

**Scatter plot** 

  - can evaluate whether there are outliers in the IV estimates

# Solutions

**Weak Instruments**

- Use Median Weighted Estimation Method
  - only have of the SNPs need to meet the assumptions above
  
**horizontal pleiotropy**

- Use Egger Estimation Method
  - MR Egger method would result in a better estimate than IVW



# Other Limitations

**developmenal compensation /canalization**

   - solution: careful interpretation of results, realizing that both environmental and genetic factors influence an outcome.
   
   - bias towards null
   
**collider bias**

  - be careful in how we interpret the results of our analysis. Based on current knowledge could the relationship we see in our study be due to other biases like loss to follow up.


# Data Description - Exposures
Data obtained using IEU GWAS database

**GWAS **
Curated from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog of significant associations found in different GWAS studies to include only data that has the required information to perform MR analyis. Catalog was further cleaned so that the unit of report is the same.

**Proteins**

Significant associations from GWAS studies on 47 protein levels obtained from whole blood

**Metabolites**

Database of significant associations on 121 metabolites from GWAS studies provided by Peter Wurtz and Mika Ala-Korpela. 

**Genes**

Signficant associations of tissue-specific gene expression  GWASs from the GTEX study. 


**Methylation**

Significant hits from GWASs on DNA methylation levels performed on mothers and children, with five timepoints during the lifecourse (e.g. child - birth, child - childhood, child - adolescence, mother - pregnancy, mother - middle age).


# Data Description - Outcomes

**Pilling**
Results from GWAS study of parental longevity (combined monther's and father's age) on UK Biobank participants. Participants whose parental longevity was in the top 10 percent were compared with all other UK Biobank participants who met the inclusion criteria. 

**Timmers**
GWAS results from 1 million parental lifespans of 500,000 particpants with data on mortalilty risk factors.

# Conclusion

- lots of significant exposures

- mostly cardiovascular and neurologically related

- Toenail Selenium was significant in Pilling as significant put not in any of the other studies

- Thyroid peroxidase antibody levels was significant in Deleen but not in other studies



# Limitations and Next Steps

- low power due to weak instruments

- the evidence in and of itself does not indicate causation, but provides evidence that could lead to investments for further study

- further examination of significant exposures and the direction of the beta coefficients
